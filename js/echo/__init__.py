"""Echo 2.0 primary runtime package.

The canonical shared primitives live in :mod:`js.echo.primitives`. Pure kernel
modules stay independent from web, model, tool, memory, and legacy agent
packages; integration happens at explicit adapters such as the Echo turn
runtime and the safety ledger service.

The Echo package is the public architecture surface. ``FrameLedger`` remains a
public contract name, but it is an alias of the sole durable implementation,
``FileEchoLedger``. There is no compatibility ledger or alternate recovery path.
